        During World War II, the U.S. military built concrete bunkers all over
        the island of Oahu as defensive lookout posts guarding Hawaii, and most
        of them have amazing views of the coastline. These pillboxes have been
        abandoned ever since the war, but theyve turned into beloved hiking
        destinations because of the great scenery and history behind them. Heres

        gems!
